<h1>About Reviewabot</h1>
Reviewabot is your code review assistant. It helps you review your pull requests when no one else can help you.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Simply install the Reviewabot GitHub App and then all new PRs will get a review from Reviewabot.

<h2>Permissions</h2>
The app needs permission to read the repository content an write pull requests.

<h2>How it works</h2>
It's pretty simple. Reviewabot uses GPT4o to review the PR diff. Then it adds a comment to the PR with its findings and approves the PR.

<h2>Screenshot</h2>
Here is a screenshot that shows an example of a review comment and an approved pull request.
